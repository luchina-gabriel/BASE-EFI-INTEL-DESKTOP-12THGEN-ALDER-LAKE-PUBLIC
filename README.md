# Catalina and older versions of macOS

- Please configure `MinDate` and `MinVersion` in UEFI > APFS to `-1`;
- Please configure `SecureBootModel` in Misc > Security to `j137`;

\* *Without above settings, macOS will not be able to boot.*

# Special notes

- USB port mapping is **REQUIRED**.
- **`XhciPortLimit`** - Please `**ENABLE**` to map the USB ports
	- You can use USBMap.command Utility - [USBMap](https://github.com/corpnewt/USBMap).
- **`AppleXcpmCfgLock`** - Please **`ENABLE`** if you cannot disable`CFG-Lock` in BIOS.
- Does NOT SUPPORT iGPU in 12th Gen.
- You NEED dGPU (dedicated/discrete GPU (eg. RX 560, 570, 580, 590, RX 5700 XT, etc).
- **`SetupVirtualMap`** - Please **`ENABLE`** if you stuck in Early boot.
- **`EnableWriteUnprotector`** - Please **`ENABLE`** if you get a Kernel Panic while booting macOS Installer.

# Special notes [DeviceProperties > Add]

- PLEASE EDIT/ADD DEVICE FOR ETHERNET i225 (You can identify with Hackintool on `PCIe` tab).
	- If your board didn't ship with the Intel I225 NIC, there's no reason to add this entry.
	- If you get a kernel panic on the `AppleIntelI210Ethernet` kext, your Ethernet's path is likely `PciRoot(0x0)/Pci(0x1C,0x4)/Pci(0x0,0x0)`.
	- Please **`ENABLE`** Patch for i225 on `Kernel > Patch`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.2.1 and below, please add `dk.e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Monterey 12.3 or newer, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args`.
	- for macOS Ventura, please add `e1000=0` in `boot-args` and add Kext [AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext](https://github.com/luchina-gabriel/youtube-files/raw/main/AppleIntelI210Ethernet.kext.zip)

### GPU-Specific `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
agdpmod=pikera|Used for disabling board ID checks on Navi GPUs(RX 5000 series & RX 6000 series), without this you'll get a black screen.<br>**Don't use if you don't have Navi** (ie. Polaris and Vega cards shouldn't use this).

### Ethernet (Intel i225) `boot-args`
Parameter|Description
:----|:----
dk.e1000=0|Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver. However, it is required on Gigabyte and several other boards, which can only use the kext driver, as the DEXT driver causes hangs.<br>You don't need this if your board didn't ship with the I225-V NIC.
e1000=0|for macOS 12.3.1 or newer<br>Disables `com.apple.DriverKit-AppleEthernetE1000` (Apple's DEXT driver) from matching to the Intel I225-V Ethernet controller found on higher end Comet Lake boards, causing Apple's I225 kext driver to load instead.<br>This boot argument is optional on most boards as they are compatible with the DEXT driver.
